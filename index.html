<div class="Lamp_Explanation">
<p>The reason for this lamp being chosen for the lamp of the week
    is it's simplicity of a design that's sleek but also effective.
    The lamp blends in well with it's small and discreet size.
    The cable powering the lamp slithers out of the back and keeps
    tightly packed providing good cable management.

<div class="Lamp_Explanation">
<p>You maybe looking at this lamp wondering "why this is the lamp of the week?"
    Well, let me explain. I chose this lamp as lamp of week due to the amount of
    creative freedom it allows for each person, You can use this lamp's wide range of
    colours to match with your room, the clothing you decide to place on it or
    have it even contrast with your room. That's another point I wanted to 
    elaborate on which was what clothing you could even place on it, storing your
    hats, jewellery, glass and even just being goofy with it. The choice is yours!
