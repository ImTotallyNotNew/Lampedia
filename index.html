<div class="LampWinExplanation">
<p>The reason for this lamp being chosen for the lamp of the week
    is it's simplicity of a design that's sleek but also effective.
    The lamp blends in well with it's small and discreet size.
    The cable powering the lamp slithers out of the back and keeps
    tightly packed providing good cable management.
