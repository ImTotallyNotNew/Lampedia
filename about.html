    <div class="Lamp_About_Explanation">
        <p>
            Lampedia is a website made by me that is updated every week with a lamp
            of my choosing from the internet that I believe to be worthy of showcasing
            for a week. I do not have a rating system nor have any bias it's purely my
            opinion only. I do sometimes present a lamp of choosing from one of my friends
            or my partner. I do not do this to advertise for companies or am I in any way
            sponsored by any of these companies.

        <h2>What gave you the idea?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="Lamp_About_Origins">
        <p>
            The idea of Lampedia was brought upon a joke between me, my partner
            and some teammates in VALORANT. I recall a teammate shouting out the word
            "Lamp" resulting in some confusion as I had not understood that call out
            on the map we were currently playing on. The following rounds resulted
            in everyone joking around about the call out and amongst the laughter
            the idea of creating a website purely around the idea of Lamps was brought to
            life. I in my determination to continue the joke to extreme lengths went about
            creating the website and had built the first idea in a matter of hours
            due to my already extensive knowledge in website building using HTML and CSS
            due to my studies.
